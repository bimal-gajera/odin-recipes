    that embodies the essence of home-cooked warmth and tradition. Whether enjoyed as a cozy family meal
    or presented at festive gatherings, lasagna remains a timeless and satisfying indulgence.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul class="recipe-list">
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>0.5 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 pinch dried basil</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup pasta sauce</li>
    <li>0.5 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>0.25 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol class="recipe-steps">
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
      until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water
      to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain spinach.</li>
    <li>Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl
      until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the
      ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup
      pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 lasagna noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and
      Parmesan cheese on top. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and
      lightly browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
